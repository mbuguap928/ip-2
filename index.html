        <h1>Birthday Form</h1>
        <p>This form enables one to enter their birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name.</p>

        <p>Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. Here are Ghanian day names.</p>
